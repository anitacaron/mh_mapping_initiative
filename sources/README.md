### The IMPC Mouse Morphology Mappings
_Full name_: IMPC mouse morphology test terms and definitions mapped to HP and Uberon

_Contact_: [Colin McKerlie](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2232-0967)

_Summary_: The current version of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium’s (IMPC) Morphology tests ontologies with manual mapping to HP and UBERON.

_Raw data_: [download](impc)

_Description_: The IMPC's vision is to generate and distribute a comprehensive data and biological resource of in vivo mammalian gene function and dysfunction to inform human health and disease. IMPC phenotyping centres around the world use a standardized mouse phenotyping pipeline of sequential tests to identify the function of uncharacterized genes and the pleiotropic consequences of gene dysfunction. Each of these tests requires and uses a common vocabulary of coded terms and definitions to describe test results. The IMPC’s Morphology Test Workgroup developed this set of coded terms and definitions by curating from existing ‘gold-standard’ mouse research ontologies; the Mouse Adult Gross Anatomy Ontology, the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology. The challenge now is to determine how translatable this set of coded terms and definitions that describe abnormalities in mice is to abnormal phenotypes in humans.

The MMHCdb Mappings are primarily concerned with mapping (mouse) tumors to Human ones (NCIT, DO).

### The Pistoia Alliance Mappings
_Contact_: [Thomas Liener](https://github.com/LLTommy)
_Summary_: The Pistoia alliance mappings use a mixture of label matching and ontology cross-links to automatically produce ontology alignments, using a system called PAXO.
_Project_URL_: https://www.pistoiaalliance.org/projects/current-projects/ontologies-mapping/
_Raw data_: [snapshot](pistoia)
_Description_: Data was cut off at a confidence of 0.9 after manual sanity checks. The data referenced here corresponds to a 2018 snapshot of the PAXO mapping pipeline. Datafiles available:
